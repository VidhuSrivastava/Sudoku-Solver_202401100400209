Methodology

1.The program welcomes the user and asks if they want to enter their own Sudoku puzzle or use a default one.

2.If the user chooses to enter their own puzzle, they input the 9x9 Sudoku grid with 0s representing empty cells.

3.If the user chooses not to enter a puzzle, a default Sudoku puzzle is provided.

4.The program uses the Backtracking Algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.

5.Once solved, the completed Sudoku grid is displayed to the user.

6.A thank-you message is shown at the end of the execution.
